  ["The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.\
    \ It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred\
    \ to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.\
    \ A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges\
    \ freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship\
    \ and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various\
    \ cat registries.\n\nThe cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species:\
    \ it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws\
    \ adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well\
    \ developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling,\
    \ hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator\
    \ that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter\
    \ but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency\
    \ for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. Cats also\
    \ secrete and perceive pheromones.\n\nFemale domestic cats can have kittens from\
    \ spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.\
    \ Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby\
    \ known as cat fancy. Population control of cats may be affected by spaying and\
    \ neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted\
    \ in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of\
    \ entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.\n\nCats were first domesticated in\
    \ the Near East around 7500 BC. It was long thought that cat domestication began\
    \ in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC.  there were\
    \ an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.  the\
    \ domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6\
    \ million cats owned and around 42 million households own at least one cat. In\
    \ the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of\
    \ 10.9 million pet cats\n\nEtymology and naming\nThe origin of the English word\
    \ cat, Old English , is thought to be the Late Latin word , which was first used\
    \ at the beginning of the 6th century. It was suggested that the word 'cattus'\
    \ is derived from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic  , \"tomcat\", or its feminine\
    \ form suffixed with .\nThe Late Latin word may be derived from another Afro-Asiatic\
    \ or Nilo-Saharan language. The Nubian word  \"wildcat\" and Nobiin  are possible\
    \ sources or cognates. The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic   ~  . It is\
    \ \"equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word,\
    \ imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic\". The word\
    \ may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately\
    \ be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sami , \"female stoat\", and Hungarian\
    \ , \"lady, female stoat\"; from Proto-Uralic *k\xE4\u010Fw\xE4, \"female (of\
    \ a furred animal)\".\n\nThe English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is\
    \ attested from the 16th century and may have been introduced from Dutch  or from\
    \ Low German , related to Swedish , or Norwegian , . Similar forms exist in Lithuanian\
    \  and Irish  or . The etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have simply\
    \ arisen from a sound used to attract a cat.\n\nA male cat is called a tom or\
    \ tomcat (or a gib, if neutered). An unspayed female is called a queen, especially\
    \ in a cat-breeding context. A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten. In Early\
    \ Modern English, the word kitten was interchangeable with the now-obsolete word\
    \ catling. A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder or a glaring.\n\nTaxonomy\n\
    The scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic\
    \ cat. Felis catus domesticus was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben\
    \ in 1777. Felis daemon proposed by Konstantin Alekseevich Satunin in 1904 was\
    \ a black cat from the Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat.\n\n\
    In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that the\
    \ domestic cat is a distinct species, namely Felis catus.\nIn 2007, it was considered\
    \ a subspecies, F. silvestris catus, of the European wildcat (F. silvestris) following\
    \ results of phylogenetic research. In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce\
    \ followed the recommendation of the ICZN in regarding the domestic cat as a distinct\
    \ species, Felis catus.\n\nEvolution\n\nThe domestic cat is a member of the Felidae,\
    \ a family that had a common ancestor about 10\u201315 million years ago.\nThe\
    \ genus Felis diverged from other Felidae around 6\u20137 million years ago. Results\
    \ of phylogenetic research confirm that the wild Felis species evolved through\
    \ sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas the domestic cat evolved through\
    \ artificial selection. The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are\
    \ diploid and both possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20,000 genes. The leopard\
    \ cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500\
    \ BC. This line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic\
    \ cat populations of today.\n\nDomestication\n\nThe earliest known indication\
    \ for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was excavated close by a human\
    \ Neolithic grave in Shillourokambos, southern Cyprus, dating to about 7500\u2013\
    7200 BC. Since there is no evidence of native\n"
  ,"Plate tectonics (from the , from the ) is the generally accepted scientific\
    \ theory that considers the Earth's lithosphere to comprise a number of large\
    \ tectonic plates which have been slowly moving since about 3.4 billion years\
    \ ago. The model builds on the concept of continental drift, an idea developed\
    \ during the first decades of the 20th century. Plate tectonics came to be generally\
    \ accepted by geoscientists  after seafloor spreading was validated in the mid\
    \ to late 1960s.\n\nEarth's lithosphere, which is the rigid outermost shell of\
    \ a planet (the crust and upper mantle), is broken into seven or eight major plates\
    \ (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates. Where the plates\
    \ meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary: convergent, divergent,\
    \ or transform. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic\
    \ trench formation occur along these plate boundaries (or faults). The relative\
    \ movement of the plates typically ranges from zero to 10 cm annually.\n\nTectonic\
    \ plates are composed of the oceanic lithosphere and the thicker continental lithosphere,\
    \ each topped by its own kind of crust. Along convergent boundaries, the process\
    \ of subduction, or one plate moving under another, carries the edge of the lower\
    \ one down into the mantle; the area of material lost is roughly balanced by the\
    \ formation of new (oceanic) crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading.\
    \ In this way, the total geoid surface area of the lithosphere remains constant.\
    \ This prediction of plate tectonics is also referred to as the conveyor belt\
    \ principle. Earlier theories, since disproven, proposed gradual shrinking (contraction)\
    \ or gradual expansion of the globe.\n\nTectonic plates are able to move because\
    \ Earth's lithosphere has greater mechanical strength than the underlying asthenosphere.\
    \ Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection; that is, the\
    \ slow creeping motion of Earth's solid mantle. Plate movement is thought to be\
    \ driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from spreading ridges\
    \ due to variations in topography (the ridge is a topographic high) and density\
    \ changes in the crust (density increases as newly-formed crust cools and moves\
    \ away from the ridge). At subduction zones the relatively cold, dense oceanic\
    \ crust is \"pulled\" or sinks down into the mantle over the downward convecting\
    \ limb of a mantle cell. The relative importance of each of these factors and\
    \ their relationship to each other is unclear, and still the subject of much debate.\n\
    \nKey principles\n\nThe outer layers of Earth are divided into the lithosphere\
    \ and asthenosphere. The division is based on differences in mechanical properties\
    \ and in the method for the transfer of heat. The lithosphere is cooler and more\
    \ rigid, while the asthenosphere is hotter and flows more easily. In terms of\
    \ heat transfer, the lithosphere loses heat by conduction, whereas the asthenosphere\
    \ also transfers heat by convection and has a nearly adiabatic temperature gradient.\
    \ This division should not be confused with the chemical subdivision of these\
    \ same layers into the mantle (comprising both the asthenosphere and the mantle\
    \ portion of the lithosphere) and the crust: a given piece of mantle may be part\
    \ of the lithosphere or the asthenosphere at different times depending on its\
    \ temperature and pressure.\n\nThe key principle of plate tectonics is that the\
    \ lithosphere exists as separate and distinct tectonic plates, which ride on the\
    \ fluid-like (visco-elastic solid) asthenosphere. Plate motions range up to a\
    \ typical 10\u201340 mm/year (Mid-Atlantic Ridge; about as fast as fingernails\
    \ grow), to about 160 mm/year (Nazca Plate; about as fast as hair grows). The\
    \ driving mechanism behind this movement is described below.\n\nTectonic lithosphere\
    \ plates consist of lithospheric mantle overlain by one or two types of crustal\
    \ material: oceanic crust (in older texts called sima from silicon and magnesium)\
    \ and continental crust (sial from silicon and aluminium). Average oceanic lithosphere\
    \ is typically  thick; its thickness is a function of its age: as time passes,\
    \ it conductively cools and subjacent cooling mantle is added to its base. Because\
    \ it is formed at mid-ocean ridges and spreads outwards, its thickness is therefore\
    \ a function of its distance from the mid-ocean ridge where it was formed. For\
    \ a typical distance that oceanic lithosphere must travel before being subducted,\
    \ the thickness varies from about  thick at mid-ocean ridges to greater than \
    \ at subduction zones; for shorter or longer distances, the subduction zone (and\
    \ therefore also the mean) thickness becomes smaller or larger, respectively.\
    \ Continental lithosphere is typically about 200 km thick, though this varies\
    \ considerably between basins, mountain ranges, and stable cratonic interiors\
    \ of continents.\n\nThe location where two plates meet is called a plate boundary.\
    \ Plate boundaries are commonly associated with geological events such as earthquakes\
    \ and the creation of topographic features such as mountains, volcanoes, mid-ocean\
    \ ridges,\n"
  ,"World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2,\
    \ was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority\
    \ of the world's countries\u2014including all of the great powers\u2014forming\
    \ two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. In a total\
    \ war directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries,\
    \ the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific\
    \ capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian\
    \ and military resources. Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, enabling\
    \ the strategic bombing of population centres and the only two uses of nuclear\
    \ weapons in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history;\
    \ it resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, a majority being civilians. Tens\
    \ of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation,\
    \ massacres, and disease.  In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were\
    \ occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese\
    \ leaders.\n\nWorld War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September\
    \ 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom\
    \ and France subsequently declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov\u2013\
    Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland\
    \ and marked out their \"spheres of influence\" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia,\
    \ Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns\
    \ and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and\
    \ formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan (along with other countries later\
    \ on). Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the\
    \ fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European\
    \ Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle\
    \ of Britain, the Blitz of the UK, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June\
    \ 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union,\
    \ opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history.\n\nJapan,\
    \ which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of\
    \ China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories\
    \ with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific,\
    \ including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United\
    \ States declaring war against Japan. Therefore the European Axis powers declared\
    \ war on the United States in solidarity. Japan soon captured much of the western\
    \ Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle\
    \ of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad\
    \ in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943\u2014including a series of German\
    \ defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian\
    \ mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific\u2014cost the Axis powers their\
    \ initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the\
    \ Western Allies invaded German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained\
    \ its territorial losses and turned towards Germany and its allies. During 1944\
    \ and 1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled\
    \ the Japanese Navy and captured key western Pacific islands.\n\nThe war in Europe\
    \ concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories, and the invasion\
    \ of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the fall\
    \ of Berlin to Soviet troops, Hitler's suicide and the German unconditional surrender\
    \ on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945\
    \ and the refusal of Japan to surrender on its terms, the United States dropped\
    \ the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima, on 6 August, and\
    \ Nagasaki, on 9 August. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago,\
    \ the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet entry into the\
    \ war against Japan and its invasion of Manchuria, Japan announced its intention\
    \ to surrender on 15 August, then signed the surrender document on 2 September\
    \ 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies.\n\nWorld War II changed\
    \ the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The United Nations\
    \ (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future\
    \ conflicts, great powers\u2014China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom,\
    \ and the United States\u2014became the permanent members of its Security Council.\
    \ The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting\
    \ the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European\
    \ devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation\
    \ of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards\
    \ economic recovery and expansion. Political and economic integration, especially\
    \ in Europe, began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities\
    \ and forge a sense of common identity.\n\nStart and end dates \n\nIt is generally\
    \ considered that in Europe World War II  started on 1 September 1939, beginning\

  ,"The cell (from the Latin word 'cellula' meaning \"small room\") is the\
    \ basic structural and functional unit of life. Every cell consists of a cytoplasm\
    \ enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins\
    \ and nucleic acids. \n\nMost plant and animal cells are only visible under a\
    \ light microscope, with dimensions between 1 and 100 micrometres. Electron microscopy\
    \ gives a much higher resolution showing greatly detailed cell structure. Organisms\
    \ can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell such as bacteria)\
    \ or multicellular (including plants and animals). Most unicellular organisms\
    \ are classed as microorganisms. The number of cells in plants and animals varies\
    \ from species to species; it has been approximated that the human body contains\
    \ roughly 40 trillion (4\xD71013) cells. The brain accounts for around 80 billion\
    \ of these cells.\n\nCell biology is the study of cells, which were discovered\
    \ by Robert Hooke in 1665, who named them for their resemblance to cells inhabited\
    \ by Christian monks in a monastery. Cell theory, first developed in 1839 by Matthias\
    \ Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann, states that all organisms are composed\
    \ of one or more cells, that cells are the fundamental unit of structure and function\
    \ in all living organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells. Cells\
    \ emerged on Earth about 4 billion years ago.\n\nCell types\nCells are of two\
    \ types: eukaryotic, which contain a nucleus, and prokaryotic cells, which do\
    \ not have a nucleus, but a nucleoid region is still present. Prokaryotes are\
    \ single-celled organisms, while eukaryotes can be either single-celled or multicellular.\n\
    \nProkaryotic cells\n\nProkaryotes include bacteria and archaea, two of the three\
    \ domains of life. Prokaryotic cells were the first form of life on Earth, characterized\
    \ by having vital biological processes including cell signaling. They are simpler\
    \ and smaller than eukaryotic cells, and lack a nucleus, and other membrane-bound\
    \ organelles. The DNA of a prokaryotic cell consists of a single circular chromosome\
    \ that is in direct contact with the cytoplasm. The nuclear region in the cytoplasm\
    \ is called the nucleoid. Most prokaryotes are the smallest of all organisms ranging\
    \ from 0.5 to 2.0 \u03BCm in diameter.\n\nA prokaryotic cell has three regions:\n\
    \ Enclosing the cell is the cell envelope \u2013 generally consisting of a plasma\
    \ membrane covered by a cell wall which, for some bacteria, may be further covered\
    \ by a third layer called a capsule. Though most prokaryotes have both a cell\
    \ membrane and a cell wall, there are exceptions such as Mycoplasma (bacteria)\
    \ and Thermoplasma (archaea) which only possess the cell membrane layer. The envelope\
    \ gives rigidity to the cell and separates the interior of the cell from its environment,\
    \ serving as a protective filter. The cell wall consists of peptidoglycan in bacteria\
    \ and acts as an additional barrier against exterior forces. It also prevents\
    \ the cell from expanding and bursting (cytolysis) from osmotic pressure due to\
    \ a hypotonic environment. Some eukaryotic cells (plant cells and fungal cells)\
    \ also have a cell wall.\n Inside the cell is the cytoplasmic region that contains\
    \ the genome (DNA), ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions. The genetic material\
    \ is freely found in the cytoplasm. Prokaryotes can carry extrachromosomal DNA\
    \ elements called plasmids, which are usually circular. Linear bacterial plasmids\
    \ have been identified in several species of spirochete bacteria, including members\
    \ of the genus Borrelia notably Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease.\
    \ Though not forming a nucleus, the DNA is condensed in a nucleoid. Plasmids encode\
    \ additional genes, such as antibiotic resistance genes.\n On the outside, flagella\
    \ and pili project from the cell's surface. These are structures (not present\
    \ in all prokaryotes) made of proteins that facilitate movement and communication\
    \ between cells.\n\nEukaryotic cells\n\nPlants, animals, fungi, slime moulds,\
    \ protozoa, and algae are all eukaryotic. These cells are about fifteen times\
    \ wider than a typical prokaryote and can be as much as a thousand times greater\
    \ in volume. The main distinguishing feature of eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes\
    \ is compartmentalization: the presence of membrane-bound organelles (compartments)\
    \ in which specific activities take place. Most important among these is a cell\
    \ nucleus, an organelle that houses the cell's DNA. This nucleus gives the eukaryote\
    \ its name, which means \"true kernel (nucleus)\". Some of the other differences\
    \ are:\n The plasma membrane resembles that of prokaryotes in function, with minor\
    \ differences in the setup. Cell walls may or may not be present.\n The eukaryotic\
    \ DNA is organized in one or more linear molecules, called chromosomes, which\
    \ are associated with histone proteins. All chromosomal DNA is stored in the cell\
    \ nucleus, separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane. Some eukaryotic organelles\
    \ such as mitochondria also contain some DNA.\n Many eukaryotic cells are ciliated\
    \ with primary cilia. Primary cilia play important roles in chemosensation, mechanosensation,\
    \ and thermosensation. Each cilium may thus be \"viewed as a sensory cellular\
    \ antennae that coordinates a large number of cellular signaling pathways, sometimes\
    \ coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively\n"
  ,"At the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players of the fielding team\
    \ arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the\
    \ pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the\
    \ rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another\
    \ fielding team player, the catcher, squats on the far side of home plate, facing\
    \ the pitcher. The rest of the fielding team faces home plate, typically arranged\
    \ as four infielders\u2014who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary\
    \ lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base\u2014and three outfielders.\
    \ In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps\
    \ to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop\
    \ to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base.\
    \ The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder.\
    \ With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be in fair territory\
    \ when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other\
    \ umpires will be distributed around the field as well.\n\nPlay starts with a\
    \ member of the batting team, the batter, standing in either of the two batter's\
    \ boxes next to home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to\
    \ throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts to hit the ball with\
    \ the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit\u2014as a\
    \ result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect\u2014and returns\
    \ them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must\
    \ drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player\
    \ is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A\
    \ batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out is said to be safe\
    \ and is on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt\
    \ to advance to second base or even beyond\u2014however far the player believes\
    \ can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the\
    \ fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit\
    \ is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct\
    \ result of a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in\
    \ the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence,\
    \ if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run:\
    \ the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring\
    \ a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches\
    \ base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit\u2014instead, the\
    \ responsible fielder is charged with an error.\n\nAny runners already on base\
    \ may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in\
    \ fair territory, before or after the ball lands. A runner on first base must\
    \ attempt to advance if a ball lands in play, as only one runner may occupy a\
    \ base at any given time. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through\
    \ the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they occupied\
    \ when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands,\
    \ the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only\
    \ if they tag up (contact the base they occupied when the play began, as or after\
    \ the ball is caught). Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while\
    \ the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate; a successful\
    \ effort is a stolen base.\n\nA pitch that is not hit into the field of play is\
    \ called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are recorded\
    \ strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base\
    \ on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance\
    \ to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the\
    \ strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being\
    \ hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to\
    \ whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above\
    \ home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt\
    \ down to the hollow of the knee.\n\nWhile the team at bat is trying to score\
    \ runs, the team in the field is attempting to record outs. In addition to the\
    \ strikeout and flyout, common ways a member of the batting team may be put out\
    \ include the ground out, force out, and tag out. These occur either when a runner\
    \ is forced to advance to a base, and a fielder with possession of the ball reaches\
    \ that base before the runner does, or the runner is touched by the ball, held\
    \ in a fielder's hand, while not on a base. It is possible to record two outs\
    \ in the course of the same play. This is called a double play. Three outs in\
    \ one play, a triple play, is possible, though rare. Players put out or retired\
    \ must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may\
    \ be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the\
    \ team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every\
    \ half-inning begins with the bases empty.\n\nAn individual player's turn batting\
    \ or plate appearance is complete when the player reaches base\n"]

    \ trilling, hissing, growling, squeaking, chirping, clicking and grunting.\n\n\
    Body posture is also important. The whole shape of the body changes when a cat\
    \ is relaxed, or when it is alert. Also, the position of their ears and tail are\
    \ used for communication, as well as their usual functions.\n\nThese ways of communication\
    \ are very important. They are used between a mother cat and her kittens. They\
    \ are also used between male and female cats; and between cats and other species,\
    \ such as dogs. A mother cat protecting her kittens will fight off the largest\
    \ dog. She gives good warning with a frightening display, hissing furiously, showing\
    \ her claws, arching her back, and making her hair stand on end. If that fails,\
    \ she attacks the dog's face with her claws. It has been said that no dog ever\
    \ tries such an attack a second time.\n\nMating \nCats only mate when the queen\
    \ is \"in heat\". Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last 4 to 6 days.\
    \ Mating in cats is a spectacular event. Several toms may be attracted to a [queen]\
    \ in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate.\
    \ At first, the female will reject the male, but eventually the female will allow\
    \ the male to mate. The female will utter a loud yowl as the male pulls out of\
    \ her. This is because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120-150 backwards-pointing\
    \ spines, which are about one millimeter long. When the penis is withdrawn, the\
    \ spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which is a trigger for ovulation.\
    \ After mating, the female will wash her vulva thoroughly. If a male attempts\
    \ to breed with her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20\
    \ to 30 minutes. once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.\n\
    \nBecause ovulation is not always triggered, females may not get pregnant by the\
    \ first tom which mates with them. A queen may mate with more than one tom when\
    \ she is in heat, and different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.\
    \ The cycle ceases when the queen is pregnant.\n\nThe gestation period for cats\
    \ is about two months, with an average length of 66 days. The size of a litter\
    \ is usually three to five kittens. Kittens are weaned at between six and seven\
    \ weeks, and cats normally reach sexual maturity at 5\u201310 months (females)\
    \ and to 5\u20137 months (males). Females can have two to three litters per year,\
    \ so might produce up to 150 kittens in their breeding life of about ten years.\n\
    \nBirth and after \nPregnant queens deliver their litters by themselves, guided\
    \ by instinct. The queen finds the safest place she can. Then she will clean it\
    \ thoroughly, with her tongue, if necessary. Here she will quietly give birth.\
    \ She licks the newborn kits clean. In the wild, leaving a scent is risking a\
    \ dangerous encounter with other animals. The kits are born blind and with closed\
    \ eyes. They suckle on her teats, and sleep a good deal. After two weeks or so,\
    \ their eyes open. At that stage they have blue eyes, but not the best sight.\
    \ A bit later, the best developed kit will totter out of the nest. The others\
    \ follow. They will soon recognise you as a living thing: that is a great moment.\
    \ At first, they go back to the nest to feed and sleep. After some more days they\
    \ leave the nest for good, but still they may sleep together in a 'kitten heap'.\n\
    \nThe queen, meanwhile, has left the nest from time to time, to hunt, feed, and\
    \ also to urinate and defecate. Unlike the tom, she covers up her business to\
    \ hide her scent. Very soon, the kits will urinate anywhere they please unless\
    \ one trains them. This is done after they are weaned, when they are ready for\
    \ some kitten food. Here is how to do it:\n1. Prepare clean cat tray filled with\
    \ absorbent grit. \n2. Give kittens their special kitten food. \n3. Take the lead\
    \ kitten right after it has eaten, place it in your cat tray.\n4. Gently stroke\
    \ its tummy with one finger. \n5. Watch as kitten sits down promptly and urinates.\
    \ Do same for other kits.\n6. Repeat next time if they need it. They will not\
    \ need a third time.\n\nWhat you have done is exactly what the queen would do\
    \ in the wild. You have triggered a reflex which all kittens have. The thing is,\
    \ the tray is artificial, and your queen may do her business outside. But at least\
    \ when young, kittens need a tray. Your next job is to call the vet, who will\
    \ tell you when to bring the kits for their vaccination.\n\nKittens play endlessly.\
    \ It is how they do their learning. They will play their favourite games, such\
    \ as 'hide and pounce', with almost anyone or anything. Soft balls on strings\
    \ are a standard toy; so is a scratching post.\n\nWith cats there is a limit to\
    \ how far you can train them. They are at least as intelligent as dogs, but they\
    \ are not pack animals. They like to do their own thing, and owners do best by\
    \ fitting in. Never hit a cat: if you do, the relationship will never be the same\
    \ again. If you really want to dissuade them, try hissing. It has been said that\
    \ no one really owns a cat; many cats collect extra owners, and may change house\
    \ if they do not like the treatment...\n\nIf your kitten was born in your home\
    \ do not let it out of the house until it is two to three months old. If you have\
    \ the mother, she will look after the kit. But if you have got the kit from a\
    \ vet or dealer, keep it in for several weeks. When it does go out, you need to\
    \ watch over it. The main problem is that it may easily get lost. In time, the\
    \ kit will learn every inch of the house and garden. Then, you can happily let\
    \ it roam.\n"
  geography: "Plate tectonics is a theory of geology. It explains movement of the\
    \ Earth's lithosphere: this is the earth's crust and the upper part of the mantle.\
    \ The lithosphere is divided into plates, some of which are very large and can\
    \ be entire continents.\n\nHeat from the mantle is the source of energy driving\
    \ plate tectonics. Exactly how this works is still a matter of debate.\n\nEarth's\
    \ crust \nThe outermost part of the structure of the Earth is made up of two layers.\
    \  The lithosphere, above, is solid.  It includes the crust and the uppermost\
    \ part of the mantle. \n\nBelow the lithosphere is the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere\
    \ is like a solid or a hot viscous liquid. It can flow like a liquid on long time\
    \ scales. Large convection currents in the asthenosphere transfer heat to the\
    \ surface, where plumes of less dense magma break apart the plates at the spreading\
    \ centers. The deeper mantle below the asthenosphere is more rigid again. This\
    \ is caused by extremely high pressure.\n\nContinental and oceanic plates \nThere\
    \ are two types of tectonic plates: oceanic and continental.\n\nAn oceanic plate\
    \ is a tectonic plate at the bottom of the oceans. It is primarily made of mafic\
    \ rocks, rich in iron and magnesium. It is thinner than the continental crust\
    \ (generally less than 10 kilometers thick) and denser. It is also younger than\
    \ continental crust. When they collide, the oceanic plate moves underneath the\
    \ continental plate because of its density. As a result, it melts in the mantle\
    \ and reforms. The oldest oceanic rocks are less than 200 million years old.\n\
    \nContinental plate is the thick part of the earth's crust which forms the large\
    \ land masses. Continental rock has lower density than oceanic rock. They are\
    \ mostly made of felsic rocks. These have granite, with its abundant silica, aluminum,\
    \ sodium and potassium. Continental plates are rarely destroyed. Their oldest\
    \ rocks seem to be 4 billion years old. Oceanic plates cover about 71 percent\
    \ of Earth\u2019s surface, while continental plates cover 29 percent.\n\nThickness\
    \ of plates \nOcean lithosphere varies in thickness. Because it is formed at mid-ocean\
    \ ridges and spreads outward, it gets thicker as it moves further away from the\
    \ mid-ocean ridge. Typically, the thickness varies from about  thick at mid-ocean\
    \ ridges to greater than  at subduction zones.\n\nContinental lithosphere is about\
    \  thick. It varies between basins, mountain ranges, and the stable cratonic interiors\
    \ of continents. The two types of crust differ in thickness, with continental\
    \ crust being much thicker than oceanic:  vs. .\n\nMovement of plates \nThe lithosphere\
    \ consists of tectonic plates. There are seven major and many minor plates. The\
    \ lithospheric plates ride on the asthenosphere (aesthenosphere). The plate boundary\
    \ is where two plates meet. When movement occurs, the plates may create mountains,\
    \ earthquakes, volcanoes, mid-oceanic ridges and oceanic trenches, depending on\
    \ which way the plates are moving.\n Convergent boundaries: two plates move toward\
    \ each other. Sometimes one plate will move under the other. This is called subduction.\
    \ When an oceanic plate collides with a continental plate, the oceanic plate will\
    \ move underneath the continental because it is denser. Convergent boundaries\
    \ can create mountains and volcanoes. The Andes mountain range in South America\
    \ and the Japanese island arc are examples, along with the Pacific Ring of Fire.\n\
    \ Divergent boundaries: two plates move apart. As shown in the diagram, the place\
    \ where the boundary occurs is called a rift. Magma from the mantle pushes up\
    \ and cools off forming new land. They create earthquakes and trenches. The Mid-ocean\
    \ ridges and Africa's Great Rift Valley are examples.\n Transform fault boundaries:\
    \ two plates move side to side. They make earthquakes. The San Andreas Fault in\
    \ California is an example of a transform boundary. New Zealand is another, more\
    \ complex, example.\n\nEarthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and\
    \ oceanic trench formation occur along plate boundaries. The lateral movement\
    \ of the plates varies from:\n  per year (Mid-Atlantic Ridge). This is as fast\
    \ as fingernails grow.\n  per year (Nazca Plate). This is as fast as hair grows.\n\
    \nMajor plates \nDepending on how they are defined, seven or eight major plates\
    \ are usually listed:\n African plate\n Antarctic plate\n Indo-Australian plate,\
    \ sometimes subdivided into:\n Indian plate\n Australian plate\n Eurasian plate\n\
    \ North American plate\n South American plate\n Pacific plate\n\nRelated pages\n\

  history: "World War II (WWII or WW2) was a global war involving fighting in most\
    \ of the world and most countries. The war started in 1939 with Nazi Germany invading\
    \ Poland, so most countries fought from 1939 to 1945. However, Japan invaded China\
    \ in 1937, so some started fighting in 1937. Most of the world's countries, including\
    \ all of the great powers, fought as part of two military alliances: the Allies\
    \ and the Axis Powers. It was the largest and deadliest conflict in all of history.\
    \ It involved more countries, cost more money, involved more people, and killed\
    \ more people than any other war in history. Between 50 to 85 million people died,\
    \ most of whom were civilians. The war included massacres, the genocide of the\
    \ Holocaust, strategic bombing, starvation, disease, and the only use of nuclear\
    \ weapons against civilians in history.\n\nThe two sides were the Allies (at first\
    \ China, France and the United Kingdom, joined by the Soviet Union, United States\
    \ and others) and the Axis (Germany, Italy and Japan). The war in Asia began when\
    \ Japan invaded China on July 7, 1937. The war began in Europe when Germany invaded\
    \ Poland on September 1, 1939. France and the United Kingdom reacted by declaring\
    \ war on Germany. By 1941, much of Europe was under German control, including\
    \ France. Only the British remained fighting against the Axis in North Africa,\
    \ the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. Germany gave up plans to invade Britain\
    \ after losing an airplane battle. In June 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union,\
    \ starting the largest area of war in history. On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked\
    \ the United States at Pearl Harbor and invaded British and French colonies in\
    \ Asia, and the two wars became one.\n\nThe Japanese victories were stopped in\
    \ 1942, and that same year, the Soviets won the huge Battle of Stalingrad. Then,\
    \ the Allies started to win in all areas. The Axis were forced back into the Soviet\
    \ Union, lost North Africa, and, starting in 1943, were forced to defend Italy.\
    \ In 1944, the Allies invaded France, and they came into Germany itself from the\
    \ west while the Soviets came in from the east. Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945.\
    \ Japan formally surrendered on September 2, 1945, and the war had ended with\
    \ an Allied victory.\n\nAfter the war, the United Nations was set up to develop\
    \ support between countries and to prevent future wars.  The Cold War by the major\
    \ winners soon started, but they did not fight each other in an actual war. The\
    \ decolonization of Asia and Africa (where many places controlled by European\
    \ countries were given their independence) happened as well since Europe had been\
    \ weakened by the war. Economic recovery and political integration (the process\
    \ of uniting countries) were among other results of the war.\n\nAllies and Axis\
    \ \nThe countries that joined the war were on one of two sides: the Axis and the\
    \ Allies.\n\nThe Axis Powers at the start of the war were Germany, Italy, and\
    \ Japan. There were many meetings to create an alliance between those countries.\
    \ Finland, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Thailand joined the Axis\
    \ later. As the war continued, some Axis countries like Italy changed sides to\
    \ join the Allies instead.\n\nThe Allied Powers were the United Kingdom and the\
    \ rest of the British Empire, France, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Belgium, and\
    \ China, the last of which had been fighting a civil war. In June 1941, Germany\
    \ attacked the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, which made the Soviets join\
    \ the Allies. In December 1941 came the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor against\
    \ the United States, which then also joined the Allies.\n\nBackground \nWorld\
    \ War I had greatly changed the way of diplomacy and politics in Asia, Europe,\
    \ and Africa with the defeat of the Central Powers. The empires that had sided\
    \ with the Central Powers were destroyed. Even the Russian Empire, which did not\
    \ side with the Central Powers, stopped being an empire, because it transformed\
    \ into the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or Soviet Union for short)\
    \ after the Russian Civil War. The war also changed the borders in Eastern Europe,\
    \ with many new countries were born. The war led to strong irredentism and revanchism,\
    \ which were especially strong in Germany since it had been forced to sign the\
    \ Treaty of Versailles. The Germans also had 13% of their homeland area and all\
    \ of their colonies taken away, and they had to pay back a very large sum of money\
    \ to the Allies.  The size of their army and navy was also limited, and its air\
    \ force was banned.\n\nIn Italy, nationalists were unhappy with the outcome of\
    \ the war since they thought that their country should have gained far more territory\
    \ from the past agreement with the Allies. The fascist movement in the 1920s brought\
    \ Mussolini to the leadership of the country. He promised to make Italy a great\
    \ power by adding to its colonial empire.\n\nAfter the Kuomintang (KMT), the governing\
    \ party of China, unified the country in the 1920s, the Chinese Civil War between\
    \ it and the Communist Party of China began. In 1931, Japan used the Mukden Incident\
    \ as a excuse to take Manchuria and set up a puppet state, Manchukuo, and the\
    \ League of Nations failed to do anything to stop it. The Tanggu Truce, a ceasefire,\
    \ was signed in 1933. In 1936, the Kuomintang and the communists agreed to stop\
    \ fighting against each other and to fight Japan instead. In 1937, Japan started\
    \ the Second Sino-Japanese War to take the rest of China.\n"
  science: "In biology, the cell is the basic structure of organisms. All cells are\
    \ made by the division of other cells.\n\nThe environment outside the cell is\
    \ separated from the cytoplasm inside the cell by the cell membrane. Inside some\
    \ cells, parts of the cell stay separate from other parts. These separate parts\
    \ are called organelles (like small organs). They each do different things in\
    \ the cell. Examples are the nucleus (where DNA is), and mitochondria (where chemical\
    \ energy is converted).\n\nKinds of cells \nThere are two basic kinds of cells:\
    \ prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotes, such as bacteria and archaea,\
    \ are simple cells that have no cell nucleus. They do have bacterial microcompartments.\n\
    \nEukaryotes are complex cells with many organelles and other structures in the\
    \ cell. They are larger than prokaryote cells: they can be as much as 1000 times\
    \ greater in volume. Eukaryotes store their genetic information (DNA) on chromosomes\
    \ in the cell nucleus.  Organisms (living things) which are made up of multiple\
    \ cells are eukaryotes.\n\nKinds of prokaryotic organisms \nThe only kinds of\
    \ prokaryotic organisms are bacteria and archaea. Prokaryotic organisms evolved\
    \ before eukaryotic organisms, so at one point the world consisted of nothing\
    \ but prokaryotic organisms. There are also viruses, which are biological organisms.\
    \ They always reproduce inside the cells of other organisms. They cause some important\
    \ diseases. Viruses are made of RNA, or DNA, and protein, and they reproduce themselves\
    \ inside the cells of bacteria or eukaryotes.\n\nKinds of eukaryotic organisms\n\
    \nUnicellular \n\nUnicellular organisms are made up of one cell. Examples of unicellular\
    \ organisms are:\n Amoeba\n Paramecium\n\nUnicellular organisms need to:\n eat\n\
    \ respire (most use oxygen to make sugar into energy)\n\nAll unicellular organisms\
    \ must:\n get rid of waste (discard)\n reproduce (make more of itself)\n grow\n\
    \nSome may:\n move\n sense their environment\n get their energy from the sun (e.g.,\
    \ cyanobacteria)\n ferment (e.g., yeasts)\n use anaerobic respiration (e.g. Clostridium\
    \ botulinum)\n\nMulticellular \nMulticellular organisms are made from many cells.\
    \ They are complex organisms. This can be a small number of cells, or millions\
    \ or trillions of cells. All plants and animals are multicellular organisms. The\
    \ cells of a multicellular organism are not all the same. They have different\
    \ shapes and sizes, and do different work in the organism. The cells are specialized.\
    \ This means they do only some kinds of work. By themselves, they cannot do everything\
    \ that the organism needs to live. They need other cells to do other work. They\
    \ live together, but cannot live alone.\n\nCell history \nCells were discovered\
    \ by Robert Hooke (1635\u20131703). He used a compound microscope with two lenses\
    \ to look at the structure of cork, and to look at leaves and some insects. He\
    \ did this from about 1660, and reported it in his book Micrographica in 1665.\
    \ He named cells after the Latin word cella, meaning room. He did this because\
    \ he thought cells looked like small rooms.\n\nMany other naturalists and philosophers\
    \ tried out the new instrument. The structure of plants was investigated by Nehemiah\
    \ Grew (1641\u20131712) and Marcello Malpighi (1628\u20131694). Grew's major work\
    \ was The anatomy of plants (1682). It is not clear who first saw animal cells,\
    \ Malpighi, Jan Swammerdam (1637\u20131680) or Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632\u2013\
    1723).p17\n\nLeeuwenhoek's discoveries and drawings of 'little animalcules' opened\
    \ up a whole new world for naturalists. Protozoa, and microorganisms generally\
    \ were discovered, and the discoveries about them are still going on today. Christian\
    \ Gottfried Ehrenberg's book Die Infusionsthierchen summarised what was known\
    \ in 1838. Lorenz Oken (1779\u20131851) in 1805 wrote that infusoria (microscopic\
    \ forms) were the basis of all life. \n\nThe idea that cells were the basis of\
    \ the larger forms of life came in the 18th century. Finding out who did the work\
    \ has taken some time:\n\"The work of the Czech Jan Purkyn\u011B (1787\u20131869)\
    \ and his student and collaborator Gabriel Valentin (1810\u20131883) was unjustly\
    \ denigrated by the nationalistic Germans. They have a claim to some priority\
    \ in the cell theory\".Chapter 9 Johannes M\xFCller (1801\u20131858) also made\
    \ great contributions. \"It was, however, his student Theodor Schwann (1810\u2013\
    1882) and Matthias Schleiden (1804\u20131881) who got the credit for the cell\
    \ theory, despite the fact that some of their observations were not correct, and\
    \ their credits to previous workers were \"a travesty\".p97 \n\nThe cell theory\
    \ includes these important ideas: \n All living things are made of cells.\n The\
    \ cell is the basic unit of structure and function in all organisms.\n Every cell\
    \ comes from another cell that lived before it.\n The nucleus is the core element\
    \ of the cell.\n\nCell reproduction \nThe body cells of metazoans divide by simple\
    \ mitotic cell division. Sexual reproduction is ancestral in eukaryotes, and in\
    \ metazoa it is carried out by specialised sex cells. They are produced by a process\
    \ called meiosis. \n\nProkaryotic cells reproduce using binary fission, where\
    \ the cell simply splits in half. For both mitosis and binary fission the cell\
    \ must replicate (copy) all its genetic information (DNA) so that each new cell\
    \ will have a copy.\n\nRelated pages \nCytology\nPlant cell\n\nReferences \n\n\

  sport: "Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played on a field by two teams against\
    \ each other. In baseball, a player on one team throws a small round ball at a\
    \ player on the other team, who tries to hit it with a bat. Then the player who\
    \ hits the ball has to run around the field. Players get runs by running around\
    \ in a full circle around three points on the ground called bases, to back where\
    \ they started, which is called home plate. They have to do this without getting\
    \ caught by the players on the other team.\n\nBaseball started in the United States\
    \ in the 1700s and 1800s. Many people in North America, South America, and East\
    \ Asia play baseball, but the sport is most known in the United States and Japan.\
    \ In the U.S., baseball is called the national pastime, because so many people\
    \ in the United States used to spend a lot of time playing or watching baseball\
    \ games. Today, though, most Americans follow football more than baseball, especially\
    \ when it comes time for the Super Bowl.\n\nHow baseball is played \n\nA game\
    \ of baseball is played by two teams on a baseball field. Each team has 9 players.\
    \ There are also 4 umpires. There is one for where young players play. Umpires\
    \ watch everything carefully to decide what happened, make calls about a play,\
    \ and make sure everyone follows the rules.\n\nOn a baseball field, there are\
    \ four bases. The bases form a diamond that goes around the field to the right\
    \ from the starting base. The starting base is called home plate. Home plate is\
    \ a pentagon, which is a shape that has five sides. First base is on the right\
    \ side of the field, second base is at the top of the infield, third base is on\
    \ the left side of the field, and home plate is at the back of the field, where\
    \ the catcher plays.\n\nThe game is played in innings. Professional baseball games\
    \ have 9 innings. In an inning, each team has one turn to bat and try to score\
    \ runs, adding one point. When one team hits the ball, the other team defends\
    \ and tries to get three players on the other team out. The team that is playing\
    \ defense always has the ball. This is different from other team sports. When\
    \ the team on defense gets three players out, it is their turn to try and score\
    \ runs. Then the team that was batting starts playing defense, and the team that\
    \ was playing defense starts batting. After nine innings, the team that has the\
    \ most runs is the winner. If the teams have the same number of runs, they play\
    \ more innings until one team wins. At the start of the game, the home team pitches,\
    \ while players on the visiting team bat. Only one player can bat at a time.\n\
    \nThe baseball field, or diamond, has two main parts, the infield and the outfield.\
    \ The infield is where the four bases are. The outfield is beyond the bases, from\
    \ the view of home plate. The lines from home plate to first base and home plate\
    \ to third base are the foul lines, and the ground outside of these lines is called\
    \ foul territory. A ball that is hit with a bat and flies between the foul lines\
    \ is a fair ball, and the batter and runners can try and run around the bases\
    \ and score. A ball that is outside the foul lines is a foul ball. If the ball\
    \ hits the ground in  the foul area  rather than being caught in the air, the\
    \ batter continues to bat, and any runners must return to the base that they were\
    \ on before the ball was hit. If the batter has fewer than two strikes, a foul\
    \ ball counts as a strike. If the batter already has two strikes, and the foul\
    \ ball is not caught in the air, then the batter continues to hit. If a ball is\
    \ caught by a fielder in fair or foul ground, the batter is out.\n\nThe most important\
    \ part of the game is between the pitcher and the batter. The pitcher throws,\
    \ or pitches, the ball towards home plate. The pitcher normally throws the ball\
    \ close enough for the batter to hit it. If the pitcher throws the ball in the\
    \ strike zone, which is the area  over home plate and between the hitter's knee\
    \ and chest, the pitch is a \"strike\", unless the batter hits the ball. The pitch\
    \ is always a strike, regardless of where it is, if the batter swings the bat\
    \ and misses, so the batter must have good aim with the bat. Three strikes are\
    \ a \"strikeout\", and this is one way to make an \"out\". A pitch that the batter\
    \ does not swing at, and which is not called a strike, is a \"ball.\" On the fourth\
    \ \"ball\" thrown by a pitcher, the batter \"walks\" to first base, so it is important\
    \ to pitch well.\n\nThe catcher for the pitcher's team waits behind the batter,\
    \ and catches any ball that the batter does not hit. The catcher uses signals\
    \ to tell the pitcher where to throw the ball. If the pitcher does not like what\
    \ the catcher says, he will shake his head, which signals \"no\". If he agrees\
    \ with what the catcher has signaled, he will nod his head, which signals \"yes\"\
    .\n\nThere are many ways to get batters out, and runners can also be gotten out.\
    \ Some common ways to get batters out are catching a batted ball in the air, whether\
    \ in fair or foul territory, throwing the ball to the defensive player at first\
    \ base (an out if it gets there before the batter), and a strikeout. A runner\
    \ can be put out by tagging the runner while the runner is not on a base, and\
    \ by \"forcing him out\" (when a base is touched before a player can get there,\
    \ with no base for the runner to go back to). When the fielding team has put out\
    \ three of the batting team's players, the half-inning is over and the team in\
    \ the field and the team at bat switch places.\n"
